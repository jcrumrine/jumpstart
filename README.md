In this project, you'll create a responsive landing page for a crowd-sourcing website. First, you will use HTML and CSS with 
Bootstrap to structure and style your web page. Then, you will use CSS to animate images on the page, the Slick jQuery plugin 
to add a functional carousel of images, and jQuery to hide the navigation bar as the user scrolls.
